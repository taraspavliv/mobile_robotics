    "The present project takes place in the Basics of mobile robotics course. The goal is to programm a mobile Thymio robot to perform a chosen task. The programm must use computer vision, global navigation, local navigation and filtering to determine the robot's position and make it achieve its objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to programm Santo, an unfortunately blue santa that unfortunately has no gifts but is dedicated to its job of visiting all the houses it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programm uses an overhead camera to detect the different obstacles, the houses and Santo's position. A global navigation module allows Santo to do some path planning to reach every target. Finally, a Kalman filter using the robot's position from the camera and odometry allows the Thymio to know and correct its position in real time.\n"
